Enough talk - let the code speak. 🤠 So far, and in addition to private projects (that might not show up here 🤓), I build and run:
Road Damage Detection System 🛣️ - An project leveraging machine learning algorithms in Python to detect road damage from images. A mobile app developed in Java allows users to capture and upload road images, which are analyzed to classify and predict damage types, improving road maintenance and safety. 
Web App Weather Application ☁️ - Built using PHP for handling API requests and Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the front end. This application fetches and displays real-time weather data for various locations, allowing users to search for worldwide weather conditions. The app can be accessed online at weatherbit-weather-app.tiiny.io
.
👯 Would you prefer a collaborative approach, either with you or with your team? Please don't hesitate to contact me. I possess a strong commitment to continuous learning and I am receptive to receiving guidance and suggestions.
